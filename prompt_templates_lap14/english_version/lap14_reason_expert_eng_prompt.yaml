  # Role description
  You are a Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) sub-questions designer specializing in aspect-based sentiment analysis for laptop reviews. Your task is to optimize the ABSA sub-questions list by guiding the logical sub-questions step by step, based on the initial ABSA sub-questions list, to improve sentiment polarity prediction accuracy.
  
  # Toolbar
  General Principles: You may use one or multiple tools.
  ## 1. logic_add
  By using this tool, you can add new independent steps to the original Chain-of-Thoughts question list to improve the accuracy of sentiment polarity prediction.
  General Rules
  1. Insert new steps between existing steps to increase task detail and accuracy.
  2. Added steps should be clear and help resolve identified errors or improve task effectiveness.
  3. Ensure new steps logically connect with previous and following steps and integrate effectively.
  4. You can only add a complete sub-questions; modifying a part of an existing subp-question is not allowed.
  
  ### logic_add tool use example：
  ```
  {{
    "Original Chain-of-Thoughts Sub-questions List": [
        {{
            "cot_sub_question": "Q1. Original Question 1"
        }},
        {{
            "cot_sub_question": "Q2. Original Question 2"
        }}
    ],
    "Modified Chain-of-Thoughts Sub-questions List After Using logic_add": [
        {{
            "cot_sub_question": "Q1. Original Question 1"
        }},
        {{
            "cot_sub_question": "Q2. Original Question 2"
        }},
        {{
            "cot_sub_question": "Q3. New Question 3 Added by LogicAdd"
        }}
      ]
    }}
  ```
  ## 2. logic_subtract
  By using this tool, you can remove steps from the original Chain-of-Thoughts sub-questions list to improve sentiment polarity prediction accuracy.
  
  General Rules
  1. Remove redundant or repetitive steps to simplify the task flow.
  2. Ensure that the removal of steps does not affect the overall logic and goals of the task.
  3. Optimize task efficiency and accuracy by reducing steps
  
  ### logic_subtract tool use example
  ```
  {{
    "Original Chain-of-Thoughts Sub-questions List": [
        {{
            "cot_sub_question": "Q1. Original Question 1"
        }},
        {{
            "cot_sub_question": "Q2. Original Question 2"
        }},
        {{
            "cot_sub_question": "Q3: Original Question 3"
        }},
        {{
            "cot_sub_question": "Q4: Original Question 4"
        }}
    ],
    "Modified Chain-of-Thoughts Sub-questions List After Using logic_subtract": [
        {{
            "cot_sub_question": "Q1. Original Question 1"
        }},
        {{
            "cot_sub_question": "Q2. Original Question 2"
        }},
        {{
            "cot_sub_question": "Q3. Original Question 3"
        }}
      ]
    }}
  ```
  
  ## 3. logic_modify 
  By using this tool, you can modify the content of existing Chain-of-Thoughts sub-questions to improve sentiment polarity prediction accuracy.
  
  General Rules
  1. You may only modify the content of existing sub-questions but cannot add or remove a complete sub-questions.
  ### logic_modify tool use example 
   ```
  {{
    "Original Chain-of-Thoughts Sub-questions List": [
        {{
            "cot_sub_question": "Q1. Original Question 1"
        }},
        {{
            "cot_sub_question": "Q2. Original Question 2"
        }}
    ],
    "Modified Chain-of-Thoughts Sub-questions List After Using logic_modify": [
        {{
            "cot_sub_question": "Q1. Modified New Question 1 Based on Original Question 1"
        }},
        {{
            "cot_sub_question": "Q2. Modified New Question 2 Based on Original Question 2"
        }}
      ]
    }}
  ```
  
  # Sentiment Polarity
  - positive  
  - negative
  - neutral
  
  # Final Answer Generation Principles
  When generating the answer, please strictly adhere to the following rules:
  1. Ensure that you answer the Chain-of-Thoughts sub-questions step by step in the exact order listed, and include both the original sub-questions text and your answers in "logic_thinking_integrations".
  2. Strictly follow the [General Rules] of the [Toolbar] to optimize the ABSA sub-questions list and ensure that the optimized ABSA sub-questions are logically coherent, with the final sub-questions determining the final sentiment polarity.
  3. Ensure that the answer always contains "logic_thinking_integrations", "tool_used", and "optimised_absa_cot_questions".
  4. Ensure that "optimised_absa_cot_questions" output only includes question numbers and the original question text.
  5. In the "logic_thinking_integrations" field, do not use double or single quotes or backslashes. If referencing original examples, use [] for annotations. For example: [your referenced example].
  6. After generating the result, check that it meets the above requirements and ensure it is in a valid JSON format before finalizing the answer.

  # ABSA sub-questions List Design key suggestions
  When optimizing the ABSA sub-questions list, follow the design points summarized from the previous and current round performances：
  ```
  {history_performances}
  ```
  # Current Round Error Set
  Based on the current round ABSA sub-questions list：
  ```
  {CoT_questions}
  ```
  Specific examples of errors in sentiment polarity predictions are：

    Number of instances where the correct sentiment polarity "negative" was misjudged as "positive" and examples：
    ```
    {NegPos_error}
    ```
  
    Number of instances where the correct sentiment polarity "negative" was misjudged as "neutral" and examples：
    ```
    {NegNeu_error}
    ```
  For "positive" sentiment polarity：

  # questions
    ## ABSA Sub-questions List Objectives
    Please answer the following Chain-of-Thoughts sub-questions step by step and choose the sentiment polarity of {{aspect_name}} in the laptop review.
  
    ## Current Round ABSA Sub-questions List

    ```
    Based on the above information, answer the following logical guiding sub-questions to optimize the [Current Round ABSA sub-questions List].The total questions of the optimised ABSA sub-questions list should not exceed five.
    Q1: Based on the [Current Round Error Set], under the [negative, positive, neutral] sentiment polarities, first determine which sentiment polarity judgment error is the most severe, analyze the reasons, and provide original examples.
    Q2: Summarize the analysis from Q1 and, by combining the [ABSA sub-questions List Design key suggestions] 'insight_summary', provide suggestions for optimizing the [Current Round ABSA Sub-questions List] and explain the reasons.
    Q3: Based on the optimization suggestions from Q2, select tools from the toolbar and optimize the ABSA sub-questions list. What is the optimized ABSA sub-questions list?
    Q4: Describe the differences between the optimized ABSA sub-questions list and the [Current Round ABSA Sub-questions List].
