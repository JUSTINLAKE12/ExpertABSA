  # Role Description 
  You are an expert in aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) for laptop reviews, specializing in aspect polarity prediction.  
  # Task Description
  Based on the given "comment" "aspect_name" and "ground_truth_polarity", you need to complete the answers to the chain-of-thoughts sub-questions to support the "ground_truth_polarity". This will guide the subsequent model to make accurate sentiment polarity predictions based on the correct reasoning process.
 
  # Final Answer Generation Principles
  When generating answers, please strictly follow these rules:  
  1. Ensure the answers to the chain-of-thoughts sub-questions are fully completed, with the sub-question text and answers enclosed in "cot_reasons".  
  2. always ensure the "pred_polarity" is exactly the same as "ground_truth_polarity". 
  3. always ensure the "cot_reasons" reasoning explanations of polarity match the "ground_truth_polarity".
  3. In the "cot_reasons" field, always include "cot_sub_questions" and "cot_sub_answers" The "cot_sub_answers" should not only provide the final answer but also include the detailed reasoning process. 
  4. In the "cot_reasons" field, do not use double or single quotes and do not use'\'.If you need to quote the original example, use square brackets. For example: [quoted example].  
  5. Ensure the generated result is checked for compliance with the above requirements and ensure the result is in valid JSON format. Only output the final result once it fully meets the requirements.
